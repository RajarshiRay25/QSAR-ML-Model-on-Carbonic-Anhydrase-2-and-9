# Machine Learning (ML) associated Quantitative Structure Activity Relationship (QSAR) analysis on Carbonic Anhydrase Datasets.
 ---

 This following repository concentrates on the ML associated QSAR experimentation on CA 2 and CA 9 datasets utilising the K Fold Cross Validation powered Random Forest Regression model to establish the linear relationship between the molecular descriptors for series of biological inhibitors against the respective target CA proteins. Considering the multiple decision trees within the Random Forest Model, we utilised it to be able to analyse the robust molecular data to obtain the statiistical patterns responsible for the overall QSAR modelling. 

 Additionally we also included certain statistical measures like Variance Threshold, Correlation filtering and Z score index to ensure there are no potential outliers and mathematically irrelevant values and samples which can lead to poor model performance of the model. Moreover we included Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to develop the Applicability Domain (AD) to verify the overall model structure to assess the outlier determination.

 Ultimately we can conclude pointing out that the QSAR Model for CA 2 and 9 can be implemented across other CA datasets as well and can be tested using respective parameters.
